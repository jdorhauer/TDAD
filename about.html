                    I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's
                    mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? We are going to make placeholder text
                    great
                    again. Greater than ever before.

                    I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia
                    that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be
                    China.
                    It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that
                    weights
                    400 pounds. Ok? Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering
                    your
                    website.

                    I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my
                    words are more beautiful. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've
                    been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. I know words. I have the best words. Some people
                    have
                    an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it
                    or
                    you don't.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something
                    else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. That other text? Sadly, it’s no
                    longer a 10.

                    I know words. I have the best words. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese
                    in
                    order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.

                    My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. My text is long and
                    beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. My text is long
