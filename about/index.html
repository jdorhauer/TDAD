            <div id="matt">
                <h4>Matthew</h4>
                <p>
                    Matt is the first of the two dads. He has a wife named Emma. As well as two daughters and a son,
                    Cecilia, Charlotte, and William. Matthew enjoys long walks on the beach, a cold beer, and a little
                    junk in the trunk.
                </p>

            <div id="jimmy">
                <h4>James</h4>
                <p>
                    James is the dude in the bunch. He does not have kids of his own, but has plenty of neices, a couple
                    of nephews, and more younger siblings than most. He is the perfect objective outsider as he spends
                    plenty of time watching a lot of these shows with those niblings and siblings. James is in fact
                    "availible". He enjoys his share of role playing games and a good laugh.
                </p>

            <div id="jake">
                <h4>Jacob</h4>
                <p>
                    Jake is the other dad of the group. He has a wife named Mary. He also has two daughters, Gretchen
                    and Phoebe. His hobbies include watching shows that are normally for children, more hockey than most
                    people can tolerate, and spending time camping or hiking.
